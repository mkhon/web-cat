/*
 * The top level dictionary contains keys that correspond to entities in
 * Web-CAT. The values for those keys are arrays, the elements of which
 * correspond to query assistants for that entity. These assistants are
 * dictionaries with the following keys:
 *
 * modelName: Value is a String that specifies the fully-qualified name of the
 *     the class that represents the model that stores the state of this query
 *     assistant. This class must implement the
 *     net.sf.webcat.reporter.queryassistants.IQueryAssistantModel interface
 *     and have a parameterless constructor.
 *
 * componentName: Value is a String that specifies the name of the WebObjects
 *     component that will be rendered to present this query assistant to the
 *     user. This component must have the following bindings:
 *       - dataSet: the ReportDataSet object for which the query is being made
 *       - model: an instance of the class specified in modelName that
 *             represents the query internally for the model
 *
 * description: Value is a String that provides a description of the query
 *     assistant to the user. If this string contains a pipe '|' character,
 *     then the portion of the description before the pipe will be rendered as
 *     a hyperlink that the user can click to open that query assistant. If the
 *     string does not contain a pipe, then the entire string will be made into
 *     a link.
