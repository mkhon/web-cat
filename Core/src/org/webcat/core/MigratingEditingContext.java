/**
 * An editing context that is used to handle migration of attribute values in
 * EOs at the beginning of their life cycle. This class does not actually
 * contain any new functionality of its own; it acts merely as an "instanceof"
 * check to prevent an infinite loop in the EO's awake* methods when the object
 * has to be loaded into a child context for migration.
