/**
 * <p>
 * An interface implemented by EOs that want to provide their own file
 * repositories.
 * </p><p>
 * In addition to these methods, any class implementing this interface must
 * also provide the following static methods (where {@code [Type]} represents
 * the concrete EO type):
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@code [Type] objectWithRepositoryIdentifier(String, EOEditingContext)}</dt>
 * <dd>This method should process the repository identifier specified by the
 * first parameter, then fetch and return the actual EO that represents that
 * repository. Note that the search performed by this method can be more
 * flexible than just a 1:1 mapping of the names returned by
 * {@link #repositoryIdentifier()}. For example, while it would accept "VT.hokie" as an
 * authdomain/user combo, it may also accept just the username "hokie".</dd>
 * <dt>{@code NSArray<[Type]> repositoriesPresentedToUser(User, EOEditingContext)}</dt>
 * <dd>This method should return an array of all EOs that have repositories
 * that the given user may access. This is used to provide a repository list on
 * the user's profile page, as well as to provide the virtual root directory
 * for WebDAV access.</dd>
 * </dl>
