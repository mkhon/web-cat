Download the latest Dojo source release and merge it into this directory.
That is, copy its "dijit", "dojo", "dojox", and "util" directories into this
directory.

DO MAKE SURE you've downloaded a source release, which is required for the
"util" directory, as indicated by the filename:

dojo-release-x.x.x-src.(tar.gz|zip)
