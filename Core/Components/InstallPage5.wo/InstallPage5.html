<webobject name="Page">
<p>Web-CAT uses the concept of an "institution" (usually a particular college
or university) to help manage authentication.  All users associated with a
given institution also share the same authentication mechanism.  A single
Web-CAT server can support multiple institutions, each with their own
separate authentication policies and mechanisms.</p>
<p>On this page, set up the "default" institution you want to use on your
Web-CAT server.  After installation, you can add more institutions if
desired.</p>
<table class="optionlist"><tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="rtn">Institution name:</td>
  <td class="t"><webobject name="InstitutionName"/></td>
  <td class="t">
  This is the name of your institution, as you want it to appear on Web-CAT's
  front page.  For example, "University of Middleville" or "Virginia Tech".
  If blank, then the short name (below) will be used instead.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="rtn">Short name:</td>
  <td class="t"><webobject name="InstitutionShortName"/></td>
  <td class="t">
  This is a shorter version of your institution's name for internal
  identification purposes and for use in certain URL parameters.  Preferably,
  it should not have any spaces or special characters.  For example,
  "Middleville" or "VT".
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="rtn">E-mail domain:</td>
  <td class="t"><webobject name="InstitutionEmailDomain"/></td>
  <td class="t">
  This is the default e-mail domain for users from this institution,
  for example, "vt.edu".  For user
  accounts where no e-mail address has been defined, Web-CAT will use the
  address <i>username@domain</i>, where <i>domain</i> is the value you
  specify here.  Each user can individually define their own preferred
  e-mail address on their <i>Home-&gt;My Profile</i> page, of course; this
  value just provides a default mechanism for users who have not specified
  a different e-mail address themselves.

  Web-CAT can store its own passwords internally within its database, and

  <b class="warn">Caution: for advanced users only.</b>
  Web-CAT can use a user-provided class for authentication.  This class must
  implement the <code>net.sf.webcat.core.UserAuthenticator</code> interface.
  In addition, you should have already placed this class (and any support
  classes it requires) on the application's CLASSPATH, preferably by adding
  your own jar(s) to the web application's <code>Web-INF/lib</code>
  subdirectory.
